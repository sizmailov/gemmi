Neighbor search
===============

Fixed-radius near neighbor search is usually implemented using
the `cell lists <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_lists>`_ method,
also known as binning, bucketing or cell technique
(or cubing -- as it was called in an `article <https://web.stanford.edu/class/sbio228/public/readings/Molecular_Simulation_I_Lecture4/Levinthal_SCIAM_66_Protein_folding.pdf>`_ from 1966).
The method is simple. The unit cell (or the area where the molecules are
located) is divided into small cells. The size of these cells depends
on the search radius. Each cell stores the list of atoms in its area;
these lists are used for fast lookup of atoms.

In Gemmi the cell technique is implemented in a class named ``SubCells``
("sub-" because these cells are subdivision of the unit cell).
The implementation works with both crystal and non-crystal system and:

* handles crystallographic symmetry (including non-standard settings with
  origin shift that are present in a couple hundreds of PDB entries),
* handles strict NCS (MTRIX record in the PDB format that is not "given";
  in mmCIF it is the _struct_ncs_oper category),
* handles alternative locations (atoms from different conformers are not
  neighbors),
* can find neighbors any number of unit cells apart; surprisingly,
  molecules from different and not neighboring unit cells can be
  in contact, either because of the molecule shape (a single chain can be
  :ref:`longer then four unit cells <long_chain>`) or because of
  the non-optimal choice of symmetric images in the model
  (some PDB entries have even links between chains more than
  10 unit cells away which cannot be expressed in the 1555 type of notation).

Note that while an atom can be bonded with its own symmetric image,
it sometimes happens that an atom meant to be on a special position
is slightly off, and its symmetric images represent the same atom
(so we may have four nearby images each with occupancy 0.25).
Such images will be returned by the SubCells class as neighbors
and need to be filtered out by the users.

The constructor of SubCells divides the unit cell into bins.
For this it needs to know the the maximum radius that will be used in searches,
as well as the unit cell. Since the system may be non-periodic,
the constructor also takes the model as an argument -- it is used to
calculate the bounding box for the model if there is no unit cell.
It is also stored and used if ``populate()`` is called.
The C++ signature (in ``gemmi/subcells.hpp``) is::

  SubCells::SubCells(Model& model, const UnitCell& cell, double max_radius)

Then the cell lists need to be populated with items either by calling::

  void SubCells::populate(bool include_h=true)

or by adding individual atoms::

  void SubCells::add_atom(const Atom& atom, int n_ch, int n_res, int n_atom)

where ``n_ch`` is the index of the chain in the model, ``n_res`` is the index
of the residue in the chain, and ``n_atom`` is the index of the atom
in the residue.

An example in Python:

.. doctest::

  >>> import gemmi
  >>> st = gemmi.read_structure('../tests/1pfe.cif.gz')
  >>> subcells = gemmi.SubCells(st[0], st.cell, 3)
  >>> subcells.populate()

If we'd like to choose which atoms to add, for example to ignore hydrogens,
we could use ``add_atom()`` instead:

.. doctest::

  >>> subcells = gemmi.SubCells(st[0], st.cell, 3)
  >>> for n_ch, chain in enumerate(st[0]):
  ...     for n_res, res in enumerate(chain):
  ...         for n_atom, atom in enumerate(res):
  ...             if not atom.is_hydrogen():
  ...                 subcells.add_atom(atom, n_ch, n_res, n_atom)
  ...


The following functions search for atoms near the specified atom or point::

  std::vector<Mark*> SubCells::find_neighbors(const Atom& atom, float min_dist, float max_dist)
  std::vector<Mark*> SubCells::find_atoms(const Position& pos, char altloc, float radius)

.. doctest::

  >>> ref_atom = st[0].sole_residue('A', gemmi.SeqId('3')).sole_atom('P')
  >>> marks = subcells.find_neighbors(ref_atom, min_dist=0.1, max_dist=3)
  >>> len(marks)
  6
  >>> point = gemmi.Position(20, 20, 20)
  >>> marks = subcells.find_atoms(point, '\0', radius=3)
  >>> len(marks)
  7
  >>> marks[0]
  <gemmi.SubCells.Mark O of atom 0/7/3>

Non-negative ``min_dist`` in the ``find_neighbors()`` call prevents
the atom whose neighbors we search from being included in the results
(the distance of the atom to itself is zero).

Additionally, in C++ you may use a function that takes a callback
as the last argument (usage examples are in the source code)::

  template<typename T>
  void SubCells::for_each(const Position& pos, char altloc, float radius, const T& func)

Cell-lists store ``Mark``\ s. When searching for neighbors you get references
(in C++ -- pointers) to these marks.
``Mark`` has a number of properties: ``x``, ``y``, ``z``,
``altloc``, ``element``, ``image_idx`` (index of the symmetry operation
that was used to generate this mark, 0 for identity),
``chain_idx``, ``residue_idx`` and ``atom_idx``.

The references to the original model and to atoms are not stored.
``Mark`` has a method ``to_cra()`` that needs to be called with ``Model``
as an argument to get a triple of Chain, Residue and Atom::

  CRA SubCells::Mark::to_cra(Model& model) const

.. doctest::

  >>> cra = marks[0].to_cra(st[0])
  >>> cra.chain
  <gemmi.Chain A with 79 res>
  >>> cra.residue
  <gemmi.Residue 8(DC) with 19 atoms>
  >>> cra.atom
  <gemmi.Atom O5' at (-0.0, 13.9, -17.6)>

``Mark`` also has a little helper method ``pos()`` that returns
``Position(x, y, z)``::

  Position SubCells::Mark::pos() const

.. doctest::

  >>> marks[0].pos()
  <gemmi.Position(19.659, 20.2489, 17.645)>

Note that it can be the position of a symmetric image of the atom.
In this example the "original" atom is in a different location:

.. doctest::

  >>> cra.atom.pos
  <gemmi.Position(-0.028, 13.85, -17.645)>

Contact search
==============

Contacts in a molecule or in a crystal can be found using the neighbor search
described in the previous section. But to make it easier we have a dedicated
class ContactSearch. It uses the neighbor search to find pairs of atoms
close to each other and applies the filters described below.

When constructing ContactSearch we set the overall maximum search distance.
This distance is stored as the ``search_radius`` property:

.. doctest::

  >>> cs = gemmi.ContactSearch(4.0)
  >>> cs.search_radius
  4.0

Additionally, we can set up per-element radii.
This excludes pairs of atoms in a distance larger than the sum
of their per-element radii.
The radii are initialized as a linear function of the
:ref:`covalent radius <covalent_radius>`:
*r* = *a* Ã— *r*\ :sub:`cov` + *b*/2.

.. doctest::

  >>> cs.setup_atomic_radii(1.0, 1.5)

Then each radius can be accessed and modified individually:

.. doctest::

  >>> cs.get_radius(gemmi.Element('Zr'))
  2.5
  >>> cs.set_radius(gemmi.Element('Hg'), 1.5)


Next, we have the ``ignore`` property that can take
one of the following values:

* ContactSearch.Ignore.Nothing -- no filtering here,
* ContactSearch.Ignore.SameResidue -- ignore atom pairs from the same residue,
* ContactSearch.Ignore.AdjacentResidues -- ignore atom pairs from the same or
  adjacent residues,
* ContactSearch.Ignore.SameChain -- show only inter-chain contacts
  (including contacts between different symmetry images of one chain),
* ContactSearch.Ignore.SameAsu -- show only contacts between different
  asymmetric units.

.. doctest::

  >>> cs.ignore = gemmi.ContactSearch.Ignore.AdjacentResidues

You can also ignore atoms that have occupancy below the specified
threshold:

.. doctest::

  >>> cs.min_occupancy = 0.01

Sometimes, it is handy to get each atom pair twice (as A-B and B-A).
In such case make the ``twice`` property true. By default, it is false:

.. doctest::

  >>> cs.twice
  False

Next property deals with atoms at special positions (such as rotation axis).
Such atoms can be slightly off the special position (because macromolecular
refinement programs usually don't constrain coordinates), so we must ensure
that an atom that should sit on the special position and its apparent symmetry
image are not regarded a contact. We assume that if the distance between
an atom and its image is small, it is not a real thing.
For larger distances we assume it is a real contact with atom's symmetry mate.
To tell apart the two cases we use a cut-off distance that can be modified:

.. doctest::

  >>> cs.special_pos_cutoff_sq = 0.5 ** 2  # setting cut-off to 0.5A

The contact search uses an instance of SubCells.

.. doctest::

  >>> st = gemmi.read_structure('../tests/5cvz_final.pdb')
  >>> st.setup_entities()
  >>> subcells = gemmi.SubCells(st[0], st.cell, 5)
  >>> subcells.populate()

If you'd like to ignore hydrogens from the model,
call ``subcells.populate(include_h=False)``.

If you'd like to ignore waters, either remove waters from the Model
(function ``remove_waters()``) or ignore results that contain waters.

The actual contact search is done by:

.. doctest::

  >>> results = cs.find_contacts(subcells)

  >>> len(results)
  49
  >>> results[0]  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
  <gemmi.ContactSearch.Result object at 0x...>

The ContactSearch.Result class has four properties:

.. doctest::

  >>> results[0].partner1
  <gemmi.CRA A/SER 21/OG>
  >>> results[0].partner2
  <gemmi.CRA A/TYR 24/N>
  >>> results[0].image_idx
  52
  >>> results[0].dist
  2.8613362312316895

The first two properties are :ref:`CRA <CRA>`\ s for the involved atoms.
The ``image_idx`` is an index of the symmetry image (both crystallographic
symmetry and strict NCS count).
Value 0 would mean that both atoms (``partner1`` and ``partner2``)
are in the same unit.
In this example the value can be high because it is a structure of
icosahedral viral capsid with 240 identical units in the unit cell.
The last property is the distance between atoms.

See also command-line program :ref:`gemmi-contact <gemmi-contact>`.

Gemmi provides also an undocumented class LinkHunt which matches
contacts to links definitions from :ref:`monomer library <CCD_etc>`
and to connections (LINK, SSBOND) from the structure.
If you would find it useful, contact the author.


.. _selections:

Selections
==========

For now, Gemmi supports only the selection syntax from MMDB,
called CID (Coordinate ID). The syntax is described at the bottom
of the `pdbcur documentation <http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/pdbcur.html>`_.

The selections in Gemmi are not widely used yet and the API may evolve.
The example below demonstrates currently provided functions:

.. doctest::

  >>> st = gemmi.read_structure('../tests/1pfe.cif.gz')

  >>> # select all Cl atoms
  >>> sel = gemmi.parse_cid('[CL]')
  >>> # get the first result as pointer to model and CRA (chain, residue, atom)
  >>> sel.first(st)
  (<gemmi.Model 1 with 2 chain(s)>, <gemmi.CRA A/CL 20/CL>)

  >>> sel = gemmi.parse_cid('A/1-4/N9')
  >>> sel.to_cid()
  '//A/1.-4./N9'
  >>> # iterate over hierarchy filtered by the selection
  >>> for model in sel.models(st):
  ...     for chain in sel.chains(model):
  ...         print('-', chain.name)
  ...         for residue in sel.residues(chain):
  ...             print('   -', str(residue))
  ...             for atom in sel.atoms(residue):
  ...                 print('          -', atom.name)
  ...
  - A
     - 1(DG)
            - N9
     - 2(DC)
     - 3(DG)
            - N9
     - 4(DT)


.. _graph_analysis:

Graph analysis
==============

The graph algorithms in Gemmi are limited to finding the shortest path
between atoms (bonds = graph edges). This part of the library is not
documented yet.

The rest of this section shows how to use Gemmi together with external
graph analysis libraries to analyse the similarity of chemical molecules.
To do this, first we set up a graph corresponding to the molecule.

Here we show how it can be done in the Boost Graph Library.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/with_bgl.cpp
   :lines: 9-10,13-41

And here we use NetworkX in Python:

.. doctest::
  :skipif: networkx is None

  >>> import networkx

  >>> G = networkx.Graph()
  >>> block = gemmi.cif.read('../tests/SO3.cif')[-1]
  >>> so3 = gemmi.make_chemcomp_from_block(block)
  >>> for atom in so3.atoms:
  ...     G.add_node(atom.id, Z=atom.el.atomic_number)
  ...
  >>> for bond in so3.rt.bonds:
  ...     G.add_edge(bond.id1.atom, bond.id2.atom)  # ignoring bond type
  ...

To show a quick example, let us count automorphisms of SO3:

.. doctest::
  :skipif: networkx is None

  >>> import networkx.algorithms.isomorphism as iso
  >>> GM = iso.GraphMatcher(G, G, node_match=iso.categorical_node_match('Z', 0))
  >>> # expecting 3! automorphisms (permutations of the three oxygens)
  >>> sum(1 for _ in GM.isomorphisms_iter())
  6

With a bit more of code we could perform a real cheminformatics task.

.. _graph_isomorphism:

Graph isomorphism
-----------------

In this example we use Python NetworkX to compare molecules from the
Refmac monomer library with Chemical Component Dictionary (CCD) from PDB.
The same could be done with other graph analysis libraries,
such as Boost Graph Library, igraph, etc.

The program below takes compares specified monomer cif files with
corresponding CCD entries. Hydrogens and bond types are ignored.
It takes less than half a minute to go through the 25,000 monomer
files distributed with CCP4 (as of Oct 2018),
so we do not try to optimize the program.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/ccd_gi.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 3-

If we run it on monomers that start with M we get:

.. code-block:: console

  $ examples/ccd_gi.py $CLIBD_MON/m/*.cif
  M10 is isomorphic
         O9 -> O4
         O4 -> O9
  MK8 is isomorphic
         O2 -> OXT
  MMR differs
        missing: O12 O4
  2 of 821 monomers not found in CCD

So in M10 the two atoms marked green are swapped:

.. image:: img/M10-isomorphism.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 100

(The image was generated in NGL and compressed with Compress-Or-Die.)

.. _substructure_matching:

Substructure matching
---------------------

Now a little script to illustrate subgraph isomorphism.
The script takes a (three-letter-)code of a molecule that is to be used
as a pattern and finds CCD entries that contain such a a substructure.
As in the previous example, hydrogens and bond types are ignored.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/ccd_subgraph.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 3-

Let us check what entries have HEM as a substructure:

.. code-block:: console

  $ examples/ccd_subgraph.py HEM
  1FH 	 +6 nodes, +7 edges
  2FH 	 +6 nodes, +7 edges
  4HE 	 +7 nodes, +8 edges
  522 	 +2 nodes, +2 edges
  6CO 	 +6 nodes, +7 edges
  6CQ 	 +7 nodes, +8 edges
  89R 	 +3 nodes, +3 edges
  CLN 	 +1 nodes, +2 edges
  DDH 	 +2 nodes, +2 edges
  FEC 	 +6 nodes, +6 edges
  HAS 	 +22 nodes, +22 edges
  HCO 	 +1 nodes, +1 edges
  HDM 	 +2 nodes, +2 edges
  HEA 	 +17 nodes, +17 edges
  HEB 	 +0 nodes, +0 edges
  HEC 	 +0 nodes, +0 edges
  HEM 	 +0 nodes, +0 edges
  HEO 	 +16 nodes, +16 edges
  HEV 	 +2 nodes, +2 edges
  HP5 	 +2 nodes, +2 edges
  ISW 	 +0 nodes, +0 edges
  MH0 	 +0 nodes, +0 edges
  MHM 	 +0 nodes, +0 edges
  N7H 	 +3 nodes, +3 edges
  NTE 	 +3 nodes, +3 edges
  OBV 	 +14 nodes, +14 edges
  SRM 	 +20 nodes, +20 edges
  UFE 	 +18 nodes, +18 edges

.. _maximum_common_subgraph:

Maximum common subgraph
-----------------------

In this example we use McGregor's algorithm implemented in the Boost Graph
Library to find maximum common induced subgraph. We call the MCS searching
function with option ``only_connected_subgraphs=true``, which has obvious
meaning and can be changed if needed.

To illustrate this example, we compare ligands AUD and LSA:

.. image:: img/aud_lsa.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 100

The whole code is in :file:`examples/with_bgl.cpp`. The same file has also
examples of using the BGL implementation of VF2 to check graph
and subgraph isomorphisms.

Torsion Angles
==============

This section presents functions dedicated to calculation of the dihedral angles
Ï† (phi), Ïˆ (psi) and Ï‰ (omega) of the protein backbone.
These functions are built upon the more general ``calculate_dihedral`` function,
introduced in :ref:`the section about coordinates <coordinates>`,
which takes four points in the space as arguments.

``calculate_omega()`` calculates the Ï‰ angle, which is usually around 180Â°:

.. doctest::

  >>> from math import degrees
  >>> chain = gemmi.read_structure('../tests/5cvz_final.pdb')[0]['A']
  >>> degrees(gemmi.calculate_omega(chain[0], chain[1]))
  159.90922150065668
  >>> for res in chain[:5]:
  ...     next_res = chain.next_residue(res)
  ...     if next_res:
  ...         omega = gemmi.calculate_omega(res, next_res)
  ...         print(res.name, degrees(omega))
  ...
  ALA 159.90922150065668
  ALA -165.26874513591105
  ALA -165.85686681169656
  THR -172.99968385093513
  SER 176.74223937657646

The Ï† and Ïˆ angles are often used together, so they are calculated
in one function ``calculate_phi_psi()``:

.. doctest::

  >>> for res in chain[:5]:
  ...     prev_res = chain.previous_residue(res)
  ...     next_res = chain.next_residue(res)
  ...     phi, psi = gemmi.calculate_phi_psi(prev_res, res, next_res)
  ...     print('%s %8.2f %8.2f' % (res.name, degrees(phi), degrees(psi)))
  ...
  ALA      nan   106.94
  ALA  -116.64    84.57
  ALA   -45.57   127.40
  THR   -62.01   147.45
  SER   -92.85   161.53

In C++ these functions can be found in ``gemmi/calculate.hpp``.

The torsion angles Ï† and Ïˆ can be visualized on the Ramachandran plot.
Let us plot angles from all PDB entries with the resolution higher than 1.5A.
Usually, glycine, proline and the residue preceding proline (pre-proline)
are plotted separately. Here, we will exclude pre-proline and make
separate plot for each amino acid. So first, we calculate angles
and save Ï†,Ïˆ pairs in a set of files -- one file per residue.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/rama_gather.py
   :language: python
   :start-at: import sys

The script above works with coordinate files in any of the formats
supported by gemmi (PDB, mmCIF, mmJSON). As of 2019, processing
a :ref:`local copy of the PDB archive <pdb_dir>`
in the PDB format takes about 20 minutes.

In the second step we plot the data points with matplotlib.
We use a script that can be found in :file:`examples/rama_gather.py`.
Six of the resulting plots are shown here (click to enlarge):

.. image:: img/ramachandran-per-aa.png
    :align: center
    :scale: 60


.. _pdb_dir:

Local copy of the PDB archive
=============================

Some examples in this documentation work on a local copy
of the Protein Data Bank archive. This subsection is actually
a footnote describing our setup.

Like in BioJava, we assume that the ``$PDB_DIR`` environment variable
points to a directory that contains ``structures/divided/mmCIF`` -- the same
arrangement as on the
`PDB's FTP <ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/structures/>`_ server.

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd $PDB_DIR
    $ du -sh structures/*/*  # as of Jun 2017
    34G    structures/divided/mmCIF
    25G    structures/divided/pdb
    101G   structures/divided/structure_factors
    2.6G   structures/obsolete/mmCIF

A traditional way to keep an up-to-date local archive is to rsync it
once a week:

.. code-block:: shell

    #!/bin/sh -x
    set -u  # PDB_DIR must be defined
    rsync_subdir() {
      mkdir -p "$PDB_DIR/$1"
      # Using PDBe (UK) here, can be replaced with RCSB (USA) or PDBj (Japan),
      # see https://www.wwpdb.org/download/downloads
      rsync -rlpt -v -z --delete \
	  rsync.ebi.ac.uk::pub/databases/pdb/data/$1/ "$PDB_DIR/$1/"
    }
    rsync_subdir structures/divided/mmCIF
    #rsync_subdir structures/obsolete/mmCIF
    #rsync_subdir structures/divided/pdb
    #rsync_subdir structures/divided/structure_factors
